<p>I am a research scientist at <a href="https://www.riken.jp">RIKEN</a> <a href="https://ithems.riken.jp/en">Center for Interdisciplinary Theoretical and Mathematical Sciences (iTHEMS)</a> in Japan. I am interested in developing and understanding methods for inferring phylogenetic networks and hybrid speciation using genomic data under the coalescent model. </p>

<p>I was a postdoctoral fellow at <a href="https://icerm.brown.edu">The Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM)</a> at <a href="https://www.brown.edu">Brown University</a>, mentored by Dr. <a href="https://eallman.github.io">Elizabeth Allman</a> (<a href="https://www.uaf.edu/uaf/">University of Alaska-Fairbanks</a>) and Dr. <a href="https://edwards.oeb.harvard.edu">Scott Edwards</a> (<a href="https://www.harvard.edu">Harvard University</a>). I was a postdoctoral research associate in <a href="https://solislemuslab.github.io">the Solis-Lemus Lab</a> at <a href="https://wid.wisc.edu">the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery</a> at <a href="https://www.wisc.edu">the University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. I received my Ph.D. in <a href="https://eeob.osu.edu">Evolution, Ecology and Organismal Biology</a> at <a href="https://www.osu.edu">the Ohio State University</a> advised by Dr. <a href="https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/kubatko.2/">Laura Kubatko</a>. I conferred B.Sc. and M.Sc. at <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>, Canada, where I studied evolutionary biology and phylogenetics, advised by Dr. Robert Murphy. I also studied the evolution of Primate behavior with Dr. Deborah McLennan. Moreover, I worked as a researcher at <a href="http://www.ewha.ac.kr">Ewha Womans University</a> in Seoul, South Korea, with Drs. Yikweon Jang and Jae Chun Choe.</p>
